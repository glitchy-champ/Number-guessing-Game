# Number-guessing-Game
This is an Advanced version of the basic python number guessing game
To play the number game, simply run the program on the terminal or anywhere else.
First of all, you will need to choose a difficulty level,
There are 3 difficulty levels:
    1.Easy - 10 guess/attempts
    2.Medium - 5 guess/attempts
    3.Hard - 3 guess/attempts
After choosing your difficulty, you will be asked if you want to enable sound effects or not.
After that, you will have to guess the number that the game has selected.
The number is between 1-100
If you enter something that is not a number, it will tell you to enter a valid number.
If you enter something out of the range(for example:356), it will tell you to enter a number in the range(1-100).
Note:Doing any of the things said above doesn't cause you to lose attempts.
If you enter a number that is higher than the number that the computer picked, it will simply say that the number is higher.
Same for entering a low number
After each guess, the program will tell you how many seconds it took for you to guess and the amount of attempts remaining
If your guess is wrong, the program will play a beep sound of 1000hertz for 500 milliseconds(half a second)
If your guess was correct, then the program will play a beep sound of 2000hertz for 500 milliseconds(half a second)
If you lost the game(Ran out of attempts), the program will play a beep sound of 500 hertz for 500 milliseconds(half a second)
After playing the game, you will be asked if you want to play the game again, if you say yes, you get to play again and choose a different difficulty
